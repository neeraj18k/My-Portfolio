        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
  I'm a Computer Science student at <strong>CMR Institute of Technology, Bangalore</strong>, entering my 4th year 🎓 and passionate about crafting modern, user-focused web interfaces.
</p>

<p>
  With skills in <strong>React ⚛️, Java 💡, Python 🐍, UI/UX 🎨</strong> and a growing interest in <strong>AI/ML 🤖</strong>, I enjoy turning clean ideas into clean code.
</p>

<p>
  From portfolios to AI-driven interfaces, I've started small — but I’m just getting warmed up. 🚀
</p>

<p>
  Currently refining my logic and problem-solving skills 🧠, one challenge at a time.
</p>

<p>
  Powered by ☕ caffeine, curiosity, and a passion for building what matters. 🔥
